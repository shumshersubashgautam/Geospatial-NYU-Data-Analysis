# How to Contribute

Hi, I'm Mark. I'm the author of this project. Thank you for your interest in open data and contributing to the project!

## Submitting Changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to data-analysis-using-python](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
    

## Coding Conventions

Start reading our code, and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * This is an open source project. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
  
Thank you,  
Mark
